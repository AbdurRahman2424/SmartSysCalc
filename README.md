## ✨ Features

### 🧮 Number System Arithmetic

Perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) in:

* 🔢 **Binary**
* 🔟 **Decimal**
* 🕗 **Octal**
* 🔡 **Hexadecimal**

### 🔁 Number System Conversions

Convert values between different number systems:

* ♻️ **Hexadecimal → Binary**
* ♻️ **Octal → Binary**
* ♻️ **Decimal → Binary**
* ♻️ **Binary → Decimal**
* 🔂 **1's Complement** (Binary)
* 🔄 **2's Complement** (Binary)
